Oh, new computer?? You fancy huh?

## Steps
1. Run Tests first! `--dry-run` Then, Install Git
2. Install Oh-my-zsh `sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh)"`
3. Clone this repo and run install/install.sh
4. install.sh then calls a few different shell scripts which will install all the things

## Tests
* Run tests/main.sh to generate an output of everything that is going to run. 
Tests pass a ```--dry-run``` flag to the scripts which simply outputs and doesnâ€™t run

with the ```--dry-run``` in progress
